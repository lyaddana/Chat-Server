The Internet has clearly become the 'Soul of Existence,' with 'Connections' or 'Networks'
defining its activities. One of the most important principles of Sockets is used to enable these
networks. The chat server project is implemented in python where a TCP socket connection is
used. There is an advantage over this methodology in which the data transferred remain intact
and arrives at the same order in which it was sent. A server is a computer, a program, or a device
dedicated to managing network resources. Servers can be located on the same device or
computer, connected to other devices and computers locally, or even remotely. To create a
connection and bind to the clients, servers usually employ methods like socket.socket(),
socket.bind(), socket.listen(), and others. A client is a computer or piece of software that receives
data or services from the server. Clients request services from servers in a client-server module.
A web browser, such as Google Chrome or Firefox, is the greatest example. As directed by the
user, these web browsers send requests to web servers for the appropriate web pages and
services. Other examples include internet games, chat rooms, and so on.
